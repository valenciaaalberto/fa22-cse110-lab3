## What did I work on yesterday?
    Yesterday's work was not as productive as we  hoped, but after reorganizing our schedule, there are ways to make up for the drop in productivity. Mostly I focused on making sure that the html code from last week is readable to anyone else working on the project.

## What am I working on today?
    Today, we are working on the css aspect of our website. Ultimately, this will be added to work in conjunction with the html website we developed last week. In particular, I am developing a list of issues that I intend on completing by this sunday.

## What issues are blocking me?
    The most pressing issue we are facing is battling our beloved resource--time. In addition to this, we are facing a lack of engagement throughout our meetings, which we believe is causing the drop of productivity. Individually, I am strugging to synthesize the information from writeup, but other than this, we seem to be doing a great job.
